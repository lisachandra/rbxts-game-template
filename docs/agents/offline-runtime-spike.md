# Offline Runtime Spike — parity ledger

The default test lane runs compiled Luau inside `ree`
(roblox-engine-emulator) instead of Roblox Studio. That trades startup cost
and a Studio dependency for a reimplementation that does not implement the
whole engine. This file is the ledger of where the two disagree.

## What ree emulates

- The DataModel tree, `Instance` construction and property access.
- Signals, the scheduler, `task.*`, and virtual time with `RunService` frame
  phases.
- `require` over a Rojo project, including `WaitForChild`.
- Attributes.

## What ree does not emulate

- Remotes and networking.
- `HttpService` requests.
- Physics beyond free fall.
- `ReflectionService:GetClasses()` — `scripts/emulator/reflection.json`
  supplies a static copy for staging (see `scripts/emulator/README.md`).
- Studio-only services and the DataModel services that back them.

## Working with a parity gap

A spec that fails only on the emulator is a **parity gap**, not a broken test.

1. Reproduce with a targeted run: `pnpm test --testPathPattern "<path>"`.
2. Confirm the spec passes on real Roblox (Studio lane).
3. Add the spec path to `reeParityPaths` in `jest.config.ts`, with a one-line
   comment saying what ree does not do.
4. Add an entry here: the spec, the symptom, what it needs, and whether an
   upstream ree fix would remove it.

`test.sh` reads `reeParityPaths` and routes a targeting pattern to the Studio
backend automatically. The emulator lane skips those specs, so a full
`pnpm test` stays green while the gap is documented in one place.
